This very simplt Todo App demoes how props and state are passed between parent, child, and sibling components, with a UI designed to add and delete **toDoItem** objects to / from a **toDolist** array. 

## Outline

```
toDolist = [{…},{…},{…},{…}]
```

```
toDoItem = {
    completed: false,
    editEnabled: false,
    priority: 1,
    text: "Pick up milk from the market" 
}
```
